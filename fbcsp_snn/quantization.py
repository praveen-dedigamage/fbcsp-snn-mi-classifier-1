"""Analog hardware non-ideality injection for the reliability sweep (B15).

Real analog circuits don't fail from having fewer bits — they fail from
thermal noise, device-to-device mismatch, and comparator offset drift. The
``inject_*_noise`` functions below add Gaussian noise sized as a fraction of
the nominal value, modelling specific physical non-idealities:

- :func:`inject_weight_noise_tensor` / :func:`inject_weight_noise_array` —
  conductance variation in an analog crossbar array (CSP or SNN weights).
- :func:`inject_beta_noise` — RC time-constant mismatch across fabricated
  leaky-integrator circuits (per-neuron membrane decay).
- :func:`inject_ea_whitener_noise` — Euclidean Alignment whitener eigenvalue
  drift.
- :func:`inject_znorm_noise` — z-normalisation reference/gain drift.

All noise functions return a modified copy and accept a ``seed`` for
reproducibility; callers doing Monte Carlo repetition (B15 Tier C) should
vary the seed across repeats and aggregate mean/std, not rely on any single
noisy draw.

Digital post-training quantisation (INT8 whole-model, CSP-bit PTQ, and the
joint CSP+SNN sweep) previously lived in this module too, but was retired
2026-07-11 in favour of this analog noise model, which represents the
paper's neuromorphic hardware target more directly — see ``RESULTS_LOG.md``.

    Perturbs each whitener's own eigenvalues (its per-direction whitening
    gain) by a relative amount, rather than its raw matrix entries.

    This is a deliberate redesign, not the original approach: an earlier
    version perturbed ``R^{-1/2}``'s raw entries directly via
    :func:`inject_weight_noise_array`, which scales noise by one *global*
    peak magnitude across the whole matrix. ``R^{-1/2}``'s entries can span
    a wide dynamic range — directions with a small original covariance
    eigenvalue get a large inverse-square-root gain — so noise scaled to
    the global peak is wildly disproportionate for the matrix's smaller,
    well-conditioned entries, in the same way (and same underlying flaw)
    that produced the confirmed :func:`~fbcsp_snn.preprocessing.
    bandpass_filter_noisy` instability bug (see ``PIPELINE_REFERENCE.md``
    §11a): observed empirically as this sweep collapsing to chance level
    almost immediately and its spike-event count exploding ~4x, matching
    the same failure signature. Since ``R^{-1/2}`` is symmetric
    positive-definite by construction (``PairwiseCSP._compute_ea_whitener``
    builds it via eigendecomposition), perturbing its own eigenvalues by a
    relative amount and reconstructing keeps the result symmetric
    positive-definite — a valid whitening transform — for any noise
    magnitude, the same "stable by construction" property as the filter fix.
